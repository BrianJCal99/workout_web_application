          On each inhale, lengthen your spine. You may come a bit out of your forward bend to do this.
          On each exhale, deepen into your forward bend. Imagine your belly coming to rest on your thighs, rather than your nose coming to your knees. This will help you keep your spine long.
          Keep the neck as the natural extension of your spine, neither cranking it to look up nor letting it go completely.
          When you have come to your full extension with the spine long, decide whether you want to stay here or let your spine round forward.
